# Game Instructions

Welcome to our game! Here are the instructions to get started:

### Controls:
- **Start Game**: Press the **s** key
- **Pause Game**: Press the **p** key
- **Resume Game**: Press the **r** key
- **Restart Game**: Press **Shift + r** keys

### Gameplay:
- Rub the index.html in your favorite browser.
- Ghosts move randomly on the game screen.
- If a collision occurs between the main triangle and a ghost, 1000 points will be deducted, and the ghosts' positions will be reset.
- To make the game fairer, the deduction has been increased from 500 to 1000 points.

### Special Feature:
- If the main triangle overlaps with the gold square, it gains protection against the 1000 point deduction from ghost collisions.
- This protection lasts for one contact with a ghost.
- The main triangle can collect additional protections by revisiting the gold square.

### Additional Functionality:
- The main triangle now has the ability to move its head in four directions: north, east, west, and south.
